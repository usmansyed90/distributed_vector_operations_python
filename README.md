# Distributed Vector Operations Python
The purpose of this repository is to exhibit code in the distributed environment for those who started coding with threads on python. The results show comparative analysis of paralell tasks w.r.t to threads to that of a sequantial nature.
The source folder has files that cater to vector addition, finding min in a vector, finding average in a vector and matrix multiplication. 

The basic steps followed in the code files are as follows. 
1. Define a Vector or Matrix based on user requirement
2. Divide data as equally as possible for threads
3. Perform operation required
4. Consildate results
5. Compare

I understand that the codes in this are really simple implementations, but since these were my first implementations in python i feel somebody out there will need them too if they are starting with python.
I have also included the **results** of the matrix multiplication with different matrix sizes.
